# Daniel Chin Python Alt stdlib
A personal alternative standard library collecting Daniel Chin’s weird Python utilities.  

## Description
My wide toolbox of various utils. All are useful. Many are re-invented wheels. Some are unique features that my other projects depend on.  

A lot of the scripts include tests and demos.  
You can find them after `if __name__ == '__main__':` or in file `__main__.py`.  

Some small projects that, I thought didn't deserve a full repo during undergrad, also reside here.
